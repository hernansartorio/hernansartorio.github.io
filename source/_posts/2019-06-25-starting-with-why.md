# Starting with why

I’ve been thinking about starting a personal blog for years now, but I always doubted myself. Why would anyone want to read what I write? Why write at all?

Over time I’ve seen [enough][1] [evidence][2] [to][3] [convince][4] [myself][5] [that][6] [the][7] [benefits][8] [of][9] [writing][10] far outweigh any doubts I might have.

## Writing can be good for my career

This is the main and more practical reason for why I’m starting to write now. I recently quit my job and I’m taking some time off for a few months. Whatever I do next—launching a product or looking for a new remote job—it’s important that people can find me online, get a sense of who I am, what I know and what I can do. Ultimately, to trust me. What better way to do that than to put my thoughts into words that they can read? Writing is a window [inside the mind of another person][13].

## Writing can be helpful to other people

A common thought I had was that I don’t know enough to be qualified to write about any subject. People with more experience than me have already written about the same things I know or I’m learning. What could *I* contribute?

Eventually, I realized that [there’s no magic amount of experience that would make me worthy of sharing my ideas][14]. In fact, it’s irrelevant. [People who have just learned something][15] [are the most qualified to teach it][16]. Sharing what I know—even if it’s something new to me—can be helpful to people who are on the same learning path. And I know this because I sure as hell have learned a lot from people who have been generous enough to write about what they’ve learned and shared it with the world.

## Writing for myself

Even if none of the above hold true, I’m writing for myself. To organize and keep a record of my thoughts that I can reference in the future. To clarify and refine my ideas.

I’m not sure what will come out of this, but I’m betting that it’s a good enough thing to invest my time on.
